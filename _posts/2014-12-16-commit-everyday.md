I'm a software engineer by profession and I write and commit code almost everyday. Its all work related though and not 
publicly visible. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the work, but I feel I haven't been able to give enough time to some 
of the side projects I'd like to work on / contribute to. I'm starting to miss that. Hence I'm hoping to enforce a set 
of rules that will nudge me more in that direction .. At least I hope they do.

The rules are simple, and actually inspired by John Resig's blog post on 
[Write Code Every Day](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/):

  > I need to make a commit everyday (not just limited to code, but blog post or writing docs would qualify as well)

  > The change must be open source and on Github

I'm testing the water with these rules. I hope to revisit this track in a few weeks (I'm hoping end of January 2015) 
and make adjustments at that point.

I don't have a target in mind on where I want this experiment to go. I might end up writing more blog posts with these
rules, or maybe start to contribute to an open source project. I might even try and cheat my way through this by making 
change to my own [dotfiles](https://github.com/khanduri/dotfiles) (hopefully it doesn't come to that). In any case, 
I'm sure the introspection will be an interesting one for me.

Just as a reference, here's what my current [github public contribution](https://github.com/khanduri/) graph looks like:

![Github Public Contribution 20141217]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/img/github_public_contribution_20141217.png)

It's going to fill up with green block for sure, but I hope the green is meaningful!

To be continued ...
