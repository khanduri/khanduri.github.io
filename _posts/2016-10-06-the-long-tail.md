### Notes:

1. Raising the long tail (over time the Pro- Am group will be creating more and more of quality content .. driving the multimedia houses out of the picture .. People are going to diversify more and more) .. My prediction
1. Big fish in a small pond. Number one in a very niche category
1. Dozens of markets of millions vs millions of market of dozens

1. Make everything available
1. Help me find it

1. Nine rules of successful long tail aggregation
 - Move to virtual inventory. Less physical atom level interaction
 - Customer input/work is critical for horizontal growth. Crowdsourcing
 - Multiple distribution channels to offer time so customers can make a decision whenever they are ready
 - Think in microchunks .. one product doesn't fit all (Cookbook with one recipe at a time)
 - One price doesn't fit all product offerings
 - Share information for more recommendations
 - Think on "and" ignore the "or"
 - Place trust in the market .. colaborative filters
 - Leverage the power of free .. "freemium:

1. If we dramatically lower cost of production and distribution, we can offer far more variety
1. Given more variety and tools to organize the information, people will increasingly revel in their differences
