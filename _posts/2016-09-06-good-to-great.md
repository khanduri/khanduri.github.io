![Good To Great]({{ site.url }}/assets/books/good_to_great.jpg)

### Notes:

1. We don't get to great because good becomes good enough
1. Put the best people on the best opportunities. Not the biggest problems
1. Hedgehog concept
  * What are you deeply passionate about
  * What can you do best in the world
  * What drives your economic engine
1. The [stockdale paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stockdale#Stockdale_Paradox)
1. Get the right people on the bus
1. Confront the brutal facts of reality
1. Create a climate where truth is heard
1. Work within the 3 topics of the clear hedgehog concept
1. *Profits and cash flows are like blood and water to a healthy body: They are absolutely essential for life, but not the point of life*

1. The books tries to focus on sustaining greatness. This is very different than making a good decision that leads to success
1. Stockdale's paradox is a little hard for me to understand. The core is to:
  - "retain faith that you will prevail" AND
  - "confront the most brutal facts of your current reality"
1. The book focued on a few key points for me:
  - Leadership qualities: Focus on doing good instead of making money
  - Team: Right people on the bus and wrong people off
  - Environment: let the truth be heard without fear of punishment
