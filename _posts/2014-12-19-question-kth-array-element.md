###Problem
Given an array of integers find the k-th element in the sorted order (not the k-th distinct element).

So, if the array is [3, 1, 2, 1, 4] and k is 3 then the result is 2, because itâ€™s the 3rd element in sorted order
(but the 3rd distinct element is 3)

###Algorithm
An easy way out is by using python *[heapq](https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html)* module. The main idea being
keep a priority queue of length *k* while reading the input stream of values. Once done, just pop what's at the top.
