###Problem
Given an array of integers find the kth element in the sorted order (not the kth distinct element). So, if the array 
is [3, 1, 2, 1, 4] and k is 3 then the result is 2, because itâ€™s the 3rd element in sorted order (but the 3rd distinct 
element is 3)

###My solution
Here's an easy way out by using pythons heapq module:
