A while ago I started experimenting with [comminting everyday]({% post_url 2014-12-16-commit-everyday %}). The rules were simple:

  > I need to make a commit everyday (not just limited to code, but blog post or writing docs would qualify as well)

  > The change must be open source and on Github

The following is a before and after of my [github public contribution](https://github.com/khanduri/) graph (about 1.5 month of data):

##Before - 2014 Dec 17
![Github Public Contribution 20141217]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/img/github_public_contribution_20141217.png)

##After - 2015 Jan 31
![Github Public Contribution 20150131]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/img/github_public_contribution_20150131.png)

##Findings

So far I've been good about following the rules and saw a few pattern emerge.

1. I finally made a few contributions to public repos that other folks started. I still have a long way to go when contributing more on pen source, but at least I have a start.
1. I started this [blog]({{ HOME_PATH }}) (and have been regular at documenting my findings)
1. Learned a few new technologies that I've been wanted to learn for a while
1. More of my [random projects](http://khanduri.github.io/projects.html) have a live presence now :)

I still don't know what I want by continuing this habit, but I like it! So, I'll continue for now .. and follow up with another checkin/post :)

regards
