### Notes:

1. Never criticize unless you have better alternative
1. Norman's law: the day a product development process starts, it is behind schedule and above budget
1. A large percentage of fault is incorrectly blamed on humans when we should really be thinking about the design that allowed the failure
1. The concept of knowledge in mind and knowledge in the world. Try and keep the cognitive load low by pushing more and more info in the world
1. Most of the time as soon as a project starts its already behind schedule and over budget

1. A lot of interesting examples of good / bad designs, but the author took a long time to explain the theory and reasons. It got a little boring for me
1. Although, the book was not directly written for software design, I can extract a few key ideas that I think can be applied when thinking about writing manageable code
1. The book places heavy focus on [Human Centered Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design)
