<p>A few members of my family kept telling me that I was spending too much time in front of my laptop. I thought it would be a nice to confirm this :). So I ended up looking at if <a href="http://opencv.org/">opencv</a> could help me. It turns out its really easy to use the camera on a mac and capture an image. Just looping this over an infinite loop and capturing an image every 30 seconds will get you a rough idea of how things are progressing in front of the screen. And that's what I did.</p>
<p>First of all we needed in get <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html">opencv</a> onto our machine.<br />
<code>brew install opencv</code></p>
<p><strong>ISSUE</strong>: For python to pick up <code>opencv</code> module I had to:</p>
<p><code>export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/Cellar/opencv/2.4.7.1/lib/python2.7/site-packages/:$PYTHONPATH</code></p>
<p>Now the script was somewhat straightforward:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="python"]<br />
import cv<br />
import time<br />
from cv import CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH<br />
from cv import CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT</p>
<p># The function namedWindow creates a window that can be used as<br />
# a placeholder for images and trackbars. Created windows are<br />
# referred to by their names.<br />
cv.NamedWindow(&quot;w1&quot;, cv.CV_WINDOW_AUTOSIZE)</p>
<p>index = 0<br />
while (True):<br />
    # allocates and initialized the CvCapture structure for<br />
    # reading a video stream from the camera<br />
    capture = cv.CreateCameraCapture(0)</p>
<p>    # set the width and height<br />
    cv.SetCaptureProperty(capture, CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640 )<br />
    cv.SetCaptureProperty(capture, CV_CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480 )</p>
<p>    # grabs a frame from camera or video file, decompresses<br />
    # and returns it.<br />
    frame = cv.QueryFrame(capture)</p>
<p>    index += 1<br />
    pic_name = &quot;cont_pic_%06d.jpg&quot;% index<br />
    cv.SaveImage(pic_name, frame)</p>
<p>    time.sleep(30)<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>We now have all the images being stored. Lets make a movie from these images. This can be done in one line with <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a></p>
<p><code>brew install ffmpeg</code></p>
<p>Installing ffmpeg will automatic install its dependencies as well (texi2html, yasm, x264, faac, lame, xvid). The whole process should take about 5 mins to complete. Once you have a successful install the one line required is:</p>
<p><code>ffmpeg -r 10 -b 800 -i cont_pic_%06d.jpg video.mp4</code></p>
<p>-<em>r 10</em> are the number of images per second<br />
-<em>b 800</em> sets the screen width for the video<br />
The images need to have a running counter in the image name so all the images were selected by the shell</p>
<p>For creating a video from filenames matching the glob pattern <em>cont_pic_*.jpeg</em>:</p>
<p><code>ffmpeg -f image2 -pattern_type glob -i 'cont_pic_*.jpg' -r 12 ../foo.mp4</code></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
