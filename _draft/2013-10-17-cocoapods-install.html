<p><a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods">Cocoapods</a> is an ObjectiveC package manager. If you're not already using it, you should give it a try.</p>
<p>Cocoapods can be easily installed and updated as instructed on their <a href="http://docs.cocoapods.org/guides/installing_cocoapods.html">installation</a> page. The command to install and upgrade cocoapods is: </p>
<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]<br />
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>Issues I ran into on OS X (Mountain Lion):</p>
<p>Please note you'll need the latest command line tools for xcode installed as well. You can manually download a dmg from Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action">Developer download site</a>.</p>
<p>Another alternative is by opening up XCode -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Downloads -&gt; Components and hitting the install next to Command Line Tools.</p>

<p>Skipping this step caused me to get the following (and was resolved once I had <code>make</code> installed through the command line tools): </p>
<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]<br />
$gem install cocoapods<br />
Building native extensions.  This could take a while...<br />
/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/2.0.0-p195/lib/ruby/2.0.0/rubygems/ext/builder.rb:47: warning: Insecure world writable dir /usr/local/bin in PATH, mode 040777<br />
ERROR:  Error installing cocoapods:<br />
	ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.</p>

creating Makefile</p>
<p>make<br />
sh: make: command not found<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>I also had to link the installed pod into /usr/bin/</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]<br />
$gem env # look for EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY<br />
export PATH=&quot;EXECUTABLE DIRECTORY:$PATH&quot; # gem bins<br />
export PATH=&quot;/usr/local/Cellar/ruby/2.0.0-p195/bin:$PATH&quot; # gem bins<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
