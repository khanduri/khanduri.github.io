<p><a href="https://www.assembla.com/">Assembla</a>Â is offering <a href="http://offers.assembla.com/free-git-hosting/">free private git repositories</a>. Github is a good option too, but to use their free version your repo has to be public (private ones costs near $7/month).</p>
<p>Once you sign up follow the instructions to setup your environment for the first time. Assembla should provide with these instruction as the default landing page once you signup.</p>
<p>Once the setup in configured for the first time, to add more future projects in you assembla account, all you would need to do on your machine is:</p>
<pre>git remote add origin git@git.assembla.com:&lt;your_git_repo_name&gt;.git
git remote -v # should verify that it was added in
git push origin master
</pre>
<p>regards</p>
